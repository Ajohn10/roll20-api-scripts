# Character Sheet Utils

This script provides a collection of utility functions for reading and writing
attributes from a character sheet, including support for attributes in
repeating sections and calculated attributes. This script does nothing on
its own. It is a helper library meant to be used by other scripts.

Full documentation for the functions provided by this script are given
in the jsdoc annotations in the source code.

## Help

My scripts are provided 'as-is', without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied.

That said, if you experience any issues while using this script,
need help using it, or if you have a neat suggestion for a new feature,
please shoot me a PM:

When messaging me about an issue, please be sure to include any error messages that
appear in your API Console Log, any configurations you've got set up for the
script in the VTT, and any options you've got set up for the script on your
game's API Scripts page. The more information you provide me, the better the
chances I'll be able to help.
