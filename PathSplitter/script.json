    "description": "# Path Splitter\r\r_Updates:_\r_v1.1:_\r* Pathsplitter now supports elliptical paths.\r* If a splitting path isn't selected, it will display a message in the chat with the current splitting color.\r* When the macro boots up, it installs a macro for its ```!pathsplit``` command.\r\rThis script allows players to split up a polygonal path by drawing another\rpolygonal path on top of it. The original path is split up where it intersects\rthe splitting path. This script also supports scaled and rotated paths.\r\r## To use:\r\r1) Draw a path over the path your want to split up. Set this path to\rthe splitting path color (by default this is pink: ```#ff00ff```).\r\r2) Select the path you want to split and the splitting path.\r\r3) In the chat, enter the command ```!pathSplit``` or activate the ```Pathsplitter``` macro installed with the script.\r\r## Changing the splitting path color:\r\rBy default, the reserved color for the splitting path is pink (```#ff00ff```).\rTo change it, set your splitting path to whichever color you want to use.\rThen, select it and enter the command ```!pathSplitColor``` in the chat.\r\r## Help\r\rMy scripts are provided 'as-is', without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied.\r\rThat said, if you experience any issues while using this script,\rneed help using it, or if you have a neat suggestion for a new feature,\rplease shoot me a PM:\rhttps://app.roll20.net/users/46544/ada-l\r\rWhen messaging me about an issue, please be sure to include any error messages that\rappear in your API Console Log, any configurations you've got set up for the\rscript in the VTT, and any options you've got set up for the script on your\rgame's API Scripts page.
