  "description": "# ARC.doom API\n\nThis script is a utility that allows the user to import and export characters, generate random plot points (omens), and facilitate the Doomsday Clock.\n\n\n\nTo get started, `!arc .help` will show the main menu.\n\n\n\n## Examples\n\n- `!arc .import` shows the import configuration menu to assign journals, controllers, and overwrite.\n\n- `!arc .import {json}` will import a new character from the JSON generated by this API, or by the [ARC.doom](https://i.momatoes.com/arc-bot) Discord bot.\n\n- `!arc .export` shows a list of characters with the option to view their character sheet or export. The export will show in both the chat and on the character sheet.\n\n- `!arc .clock` shows the current state of the Doomsday Clock. If called by a GM, the message will include the Doomsday Clock controls and configuration menu.\n\n- `!arc .omens` shows a random omen (GM Only).\n\n\n\n## momatoes\n\nVisit [arc-rpg.com](https://arc-rpg.com) to learn more, including additional resources and support channels. Or, buy ARC and gawk at the art, that's cool too.",
