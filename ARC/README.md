# ARC.doom API
This script is a utility that allows the user to import and export characters, generate random plot points (omens), and facilitate the Doomsday Clock.

To get started, `!arc .help` will show the main menu.

## Examples
- `!arc .import` shows the import configuration menu to assign journals, controllers, and overwrite.
- `!arc .import {json}` will import a new character from the JSON generated by this API, or by the [ARC.doom](https://i.momatoes.com/arc-bot) Discord bot.
- `!arc .export` shows a list of characters with the option to view their character sheet or export. The export will show in both the chat and on the character sheet.
- `!arc .clock` shows the current state of the Doomsday Clock. If called by a GM, the message will include the Doomsday Clock controls and configuration menu.
- `!arc .omens` shows a random omen (GM Only).

## Sample Character Import
**Note:** Before importing, remove all new line characters so it's just a single line of code.
