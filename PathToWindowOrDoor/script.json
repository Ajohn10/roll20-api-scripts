	"description": "# PathToWindowOrDoor v1\r___\rWelcome to PathToWindowOrDoor. This script helps quickly convert 2 point line paths to the new windows or doors\r### Using PathToWindowOrDoor\rThe script will convert dynamic lighting lines used as doors or windows that are on the map layer or on the DL layer.Beware, only \"paths\" with 1 line (2 coords, 2 clics not one more) will be converted to door/windows as they are only representing 2 handles at the moment\r### Basic Command Syntax\rThe script uses a standardized API command syntax. All PathToWindowOrDoor commands will begin with **!ptwod**. This will then be followedby a space a double dash preceding a keyword and options group. This looks like this:\r**!ptwod --keyWord|option1|option2|...**<hr/>\r### Converting Windows<p>Convert windows using the <code style=\"white-space: nowrap\">!ptwod --convertWindows</code> or <code style=\"white-space: nowrap\">!ptwod --convertWindows|page</code> commandsby appending the **|page** part, you restrict the script to apply only on the page you are looking at right now instead of all at once\r#### Windows converted as :\r- Windows => Roll20 Windows Locked by default\r</p>\r### Converting Doors<p>Convert doors using the <code style=\"white-space: nowrap\">!ptwod --convertDoors</code> or <code style=\"white-space: nowrap\">!ptwod --convertDoors|page</code> commandsby appending the **|page** part, you restrict the script to apply only on the page you are looking at right now instead of all at once\r#### Doors converted as :\r- Hidden => Roll20 Secret doors Locked by default\r- Locked => Roll20 Locked doors\r- Unlocked => Normal Roll20 doors\r**All doors are closed by default**</p><hr/>\r### Special Thanks\rThanks to Scott C.h, this script is started from his DoorKnocker work which i stripped and adapted to fit my needs and learn a things or two.",
