# HtmlBuilder

This is a utility script that provides a library for constructing stylized
HTML strings. It has no functionality of its own, but it can be used by other
scripts to create HTML-formatted content to display in the chat.

View the script's source file at
https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-api-scripts/tree/master/HtmlBuilder
for documentation.

## Help

My scripts are provided 'as-is', without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied.

That said, if you experience any issues while using this script,

please shoot me a PM:

When messaging me about an issue, please be sure to include any error messages that
appear in your API Console Log, any configurations you've got set up for the
script in the VTT, and any options you've got set up for the script on your
game's API Scripts page. The more information you provide me, the better the
chances I'll be able to help.
