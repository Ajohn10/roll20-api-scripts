    "description": "# Geiger Counter\r\rThis script allows the GM to dynamically create radioactive areas in their\rmaps. Characters that have Geiger counters will be alerted how many rads\rthey are taking.\r\r## To create a radioactive source object:\r1. Create a token representing the source on the GM layer.\r2. Set that token's 'radioactive' <img src=\"http://game-icons.net/icons/lorc/originals/png/radioactive.png\" width=\"32\"> status marker to on.\r3. Set its ```aura1 radius``` to the distance at which characters will start\rtaking rads from it.\r4. Set the ```bar1``` value to amount of rads/s characters will take at the edge\rof its aura.\r5. Set the ```bar1 max value``` to the maximum amount of rads/s characters can take\rfrom it.\r\r## To give a player a Geiger counter:\r1. Give them a ```'hasGeigerCounter' attribute```.\r2. Set the attribute to ```true```.\r\rIf a character moves in a radioactive area and they have a Geiger counter,\rtheir Geiger counter will alert everyone how many rads/s they are taking.\rIf a character moves in a radioactive area and they don't have a Geiger\rcounter, only the GM will be alerted how many rads/s they are taking.\r\r## Help\r\rMy scripts are provided 'as-is', without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied.\r\rThat said, if you experience any issues while using this script,\rneed help using it, or if you have a neat suggestion for a new feature,\rplease shoot me a PM:\rhttps://app.roll20.net/users/46544/ada-l\r\rWhen messaging me about an issue, please be sure to include any error messages that\rappear in your API Console Log, any configurations you've got set up for the\rscript in the VTT, and any options you've got set up for the script on your\rgame's API Scripts page.
