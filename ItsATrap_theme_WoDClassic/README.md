# It's A Trap! - World of Darkness (classic) theme

This script is a trap theme supplement for the It's a Trap! script designed to
support World of Darkness (classic) character sheets.

Currently this script provides automatic support for the following sheets:
Changeling: The Dreaming, Demon: The Fallen, Mage: The Ascension, Vampire: The Dark Ages, Vampire: The Masquerade, Werewolf: The Apocalypse, and all the forementioned's 20th anniversary edition variations.

Other sheets, custom sheets, and characters based upon plain attributes are also supported.
For those, just fill in the names for the character attributes in the user options for
this script.

## Theme-specific properties
The following trap properties are specific to this trap theme script.

### Attack Dice
