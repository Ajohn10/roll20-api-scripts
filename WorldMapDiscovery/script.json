    "description": "# World Map Discovery\r\r_v1.1 Updates:_\r* Location discoveries now display an HTML-formatted message to the chat.\r* When locations are discovered, their white-tower status is removed.\r* The script now exposes some of its functions through its WorldMapDiscovery object. See the source code for details.\r\rThis script allows the GM to set hidden locations on a world map that can be\rrevealed when a character gets close enough.\r\r### To use:\r\r1. Turn on the landmark's ```white-tower status``` <img src=\"http://game-icons.net/icons/lorc/originals/png/white-tower.png\" width=\"32\" >.\r2. Set the landmark's ```aura 1 radius``` to whatever radius you want players to come within to discover the landmark.\r3. Put the landmark on the ```GM layer```.\r\r### Discovering landmarks:\r\rWhen a character token moves within the aura radius of the landmark, the landmark\rwill appear on the graphics layer and a message will be displayed\rtelling everyone that the character discovered it. When the landmark is\rdiscovered, its aura1 radius is removed.\r\r## Help\r\rMy scripts are provided 'as-is', without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied.\r\rThat said, if you experience any issues while using this script,\rneed help using it, or if you have a neat suggestion for a new feature,\rplease shoot me a PM:\rhttps://app.roll20.net/users/46544/ada-l\r\rWhen messaging me about an issue, please be sure to include any error messages that\rappear in your API Console Log, any configurations you've got set up for the\rscript in the VTT, and any options you've got set up for the script on your\rgame's API Scripts page.
