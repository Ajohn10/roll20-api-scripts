    "description": "# It's A Trap! - Roleplaying is Magic 4E theme\r\rThis is a My Little Pony: Roleplaying is Magic 4th edition theme for the It's A Trap! script,\rbuilt for use with the Roleplaying is Magic 4E character sheet.\r\r## Theme-specific properties\rThe following trap properties are specific to this trap theme script.\r\r### Damage\rA dice roll expression for the trap's damage.\r\r### Miss - Half Damage\rThis property specifies whether the trap still deals half damage, even on a miss.\r\r### Skill Check\rThis property specifies the skill roll needed to avoid the trap.\r\rThe first prompt asks for the name of the skill.\r\rThe second prompt asks for the primary attribute the skill is based on.\r\rThe third prompt asks for the skill check's difficulty.\r\r### Spot DC\rThis property specifies the Perception skill check difficulty for\rpassively noticing the trap.\r\r### Note about passive Perception\r\rThe Roleplaying is Magic 4E system doesn't actually have any defined rolls for\rpassive skill checks. For the purpose of this script, a character's passive Perception is\rcalculated as follows:\r\r```\r4 + (total Advantage/Disadvantage modifier) + Mind + (3 if trained) + (2 if improved) + (1 if greater) + (total Misc modifiers)\r```\r\rSo for example, a character not trained in Perception with a Mind of 2 would\rhave a passive Perception of 6. A character trained in Perception with a Mind\rof 4 would have a passive Perception of 11.\r\r## Help\r\rMy scripts are provided 'as-is', without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied.\r\rThat said, if you experience any issues while using this script,\rneed help using it, or if you have a neat suggestion for a new feature,\rplease shoot me a PM:\rhttps://app.roll20.net/users/46544/ada-l\r\rWhen messaging me about an issue, please be sure to include any error messages that\rappear in your API Console Log, any configurations you've got set up for the\rscript in the VTT, and any options you've got set up for the script on your\rgame's API Scripts page.
