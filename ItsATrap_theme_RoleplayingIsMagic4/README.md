# It's A Trap! - Roleplaying is Magic 4E theme

This is a My Little Pony: Roleplaying is Magic 4th edition theme for the It's A Trap! script,
built for use with the Roleplaying is Magic 4E character sheet.

## Theme-specific properties
The following trap properties are specific to this trap theme script.

### Damage
A dice roll expression for the trap's damage.

### Miss - Half Damage
This property specifies whether the trap still deals half damage, even on a miss.

### Skill Check
This property specifies the skill roll needed to avoid the trap.

The first prompt asks for the name of the skill.

The second prompt asks for the primary attribute the skill is based on.

The third prompt asks for the skill check's difficulty.

### Spot DC
This property specifies the Perception skill check difficulty for
passively noticing the trap.

### Note about passive Perception

The Roleplaying is Magic 4E system doesn't actually have any defined rolls for
passive skill checks. For the purpose of this script, a character's passive Perception is
calculated as follows:

```
4 + (total Advantage/Disadvantage modifier) + Mind + (3 if trained) + (2 if improved) + (1 if greater) + (total Misc modifiers)
```

So for example, a character not trained in Perception with a Mind of 2 would
have a passive Perception of 6. A character trained in Perception with a Mind
of 4 would have a passive Perception of 11.
