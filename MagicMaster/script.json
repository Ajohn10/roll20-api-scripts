    "description": "The MagicMaster API provides functions to manage all types of magic, including Wizard & Priest spell use and effects; Character, NPC & Monster Powers; and discovery, looting, use and cursing of Magic Items.  All magical aspects can work with the RoundMaster API to implement token markers that show and measure durations, and produce actual effects that can change character sheet attributes temporarily for the duration of the spell or permanently if so desired.  They can also work with the InitiativeMaster API to provide menus of initiative choices and correctly adjust individual initiative rolls, including effects of Haste and Slow and similar spells. Spells can summon weapons to work with the AttackMaster API, and factor in the passing of time, the cost of spell material use, and the cost of accommodation for resting.",
