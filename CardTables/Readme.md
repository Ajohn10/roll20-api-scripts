*That is it.* This is the purpose of this script. I wanted some rollable tables which were a bit more fun, whithout having to go through the hassle of creating powercards manually for the tons of random tables I roll for my players.

* Once you have your table in a spreadsheet, all you need to do is save it, and then copy and paste it in the chatbox following the instructions
* This script will automatically parse the chat message and create a macro for you which will have a scriptcard which can do everything you need from the table
